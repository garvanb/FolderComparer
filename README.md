# FolderComparer
A simple desktop app for analysing the difference between two folders.

The analysis will report on any files missing from either folder and differences between any namesakes found in each folder.
You can quickly access the ten most recent comparisons you have done through the File > Recent menu and run them again.
For deeper analysis you can ask the program to compare the MD5 hash of each file.
